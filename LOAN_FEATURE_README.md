# BitTrade Loan Feature Development

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive development of the Bitcoin-backed loan feature in BitTrade, including all accomplished tasks and remaining work. The loan feature allows users to deposit Bitcoin as collateral and borrow INR against it, with proper risk management and liquidation mechanisms.

## ‚úÖ Accomplished Tasks

### 1. **Database Schema & Migration**

#### **Database Schema Enhancement**
- ‚úÖ Updated `operations` table to support loan transaction types

  - `LOAN_REPAY` - Repaying borrowed amount
  - `INTEREST_ACCRUAL` - Daily interest accumulation
  - `PARTIAL_LIQUIDATION` - Partial collateral liquidation
  - `FULL_LIQUIDATION` - Complete loan liquidation

#### **Migration Management**

- ‚úÖ Applied database migrations successfully
- ‚úÖ Created migration log documentation
- ‚úÖ Resolved "Data truncated for column 'type'" errors

### 2. **Backend Implementation**
