Admin Dashboard
•  User Management Page - Admin should be able to see all users(including himself) and their balances, and manage them with a single modal.
•  User Management Modal - Single modal to manage users' INR/BTC balances via deposit/withdraw transactions
•  All Transactions View - See every transaction across all users
•  User Administration - Reset passwords, create/delete users
•  System Controls - Change buy/sell multipliers
•  Health Monitoring - Check database, backend, price service, Redis status
•  Dashboard Toggle - Easy switch between trading and admin views
•  Tabs - I like the existing tabs that the admin has. the admin should be able to navigate to these features using the bottom navbar. All features should be located in their respective tabs.

Overall App Improvements:
•  Bitcoin Formatting - Remove trailing zeros (0.01230000 → 0.0123)
•  History Page Redesign - Make it look like Recent Activity but show all transactions
•  Transaction Detail Modals - Clean popups with full transaction info
•  Price Update Timer - Countdown to next price update instead of "live" indicator
•  Persistent Top Bar - Bitcoin balance display when scrolling
•  Bitcoin Value Display - Show INR equivalent at current sell rate

Make sure ui elements and modals are in line with the design language of the rest of the app.
