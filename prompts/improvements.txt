The app is working fine. But the ui feels very dry. I want it to look fun and intuitive, with a nice card style design. I want the buy/sell operations to be done in a separate popup modals where the users see the buy/sell rate and input the amount and are shown an estimated amount of bitcoin/cash that theyll receive. Overall the ui you have made isnt made with the user in mind. Like WITTHDRAW_INR should be shown with Cash Withdrawal rather than its raw term. There are no icons anywhere on the home page which makes it looks old and stuffy. and when you do use icons use white sleek icons from lucide-react. Can you redesign the ui keeping the dark theme but making it fun, modern and a little gamified.
