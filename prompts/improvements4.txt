Admin Dashboard Suggestions
The UserManagementModal Should be able to deposit/ withdraw bitcoin from a users account, by creating DEPOSIT_BTC and WITHDRAWAL_BTC transactions.
6	2	"DEPOSIT_BTC"	8800	100000	8800000	1400	200000	"2025-07-02 03:13:09.339579" 
The admin deposited 0.001 bitcoin to users account. 
the btc_usd price was 100000, so the sell rate was 8800000, an the inr_amount field is populated with 0.001*8800000. 
This is to make internal performance calculations. only the btc_balance is updated and not the inr_balance.
the inr_amount field in the database is autopopulated based on the bitcoin_amount*btc_usd_price*sell_multiplier.

- On the Admin Dashboard, on the Dashboard Tab, remove the Quick Actions Section.

I dont see any easy toggle icon to switch between trading dashboard and admin dashboard for the admin.

General App Suggestions
Make the top bar and bottom nav bar have a black background, that would look better.
The Transaction Details Modals are too big when it comes to buy and sell transactions, details are being cutoff.
