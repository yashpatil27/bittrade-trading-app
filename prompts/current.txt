One minor tweak to the transactions on the history page. When its a buy/sell order, showing both cash and bitcoin amounts side by side cramps the box. So instead show the amounts one top of the other
In the Transaction Detail Modal, ID is written on the left and the id for that transaction is on the right. This is confusing. rather Just show ID: <transaction id> on the left itself.
I love the way you showed transactions on the History Page. I want the same format in the Recent Activity section (with the clickable transactions that open the details modals)

I want the same on the Admin Dashboard in the Transactions section as well. A minor tweak for admins would be that the transactions need to the username for that account.

I think that admin dashboard toggle to switch between trading dashboard and admin dashboard is bugging out on a normal users dashboard. It shows up as 0 on a normal users top bar.

The Persistant Top bar needs to have a black background.

The bottom navbar turns grey when a tab is active, lets make it so that the text and icons become white and and there is white bottom border under the section of the tb that is active.
